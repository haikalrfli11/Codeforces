# Explanation 

We are given two string, the first string is s and the second string t

we are required to check whether the string t is the reverse of the string t 
how wo do that ?

My method is we make a new string, i name it temp.
we fill the temp variable with the reverse of the string t. Simply, we loop the string from the end to the begin. You can see it from my code

After the loop ends. We check it whether the temp string is same as the first string which is s

if the temp variable is same we print YES. if not print NO.
