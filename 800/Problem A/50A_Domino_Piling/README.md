# EXPLANATION

It is just basic of geometry, we are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2x1 squares. and also we are given the board of M X N squares

The question is the maximal number of dominoes we can place into the board

the area of one domino is  = 2 squares
the area of the board  is = M X N squares

the formula to search how many maximal number of dominoes we can place is

the area of the board divided by the area of one domino
if we convert to code become --> M X N / 2.
